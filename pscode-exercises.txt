// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

(// Prompt user for input of two numbers
Prompt "Enter the first number: "
Input num1

Prompt "Enter the second number: "
Input num2

// Calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum = num1 + num2

// Display the sum
Print "The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(// Prompt user for input of a number
Prompt "Enter a number: "
Input num

// Check if the number is even or odd
if num % 2 == 0 then
    Print num, " is even"
else
    Print num, " is odd")

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(// Initialize variables
Set sum = 0
Set min = Infinity
Set max = -Infinity

// Read in 5 separate numbers
for i = 1 to 5 do
    Prompt "Enter number ", i, ": "
    Input number

    // Calculate sum
    sum = sum + number
    
    // Check for minimum and maximum
    if number < min then
        min = number
    end if
    
    if number > max then
        max = number
    end if

// Calculate average
average = sum / 5

// Output results
Print "The average of the five numbers is: ", average
Print "The smallest number entered is: ", min
Print "The largest number entered is: ", max)
